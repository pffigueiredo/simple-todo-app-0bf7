## Deploy it to [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/)

[Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/) is the only fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) obsessively optimized for shipping and scaling Laravel applications:

- No application or server configuration necessary.
- Fully managed databases.
- Zero downtime deployments and scaling.
- Automatic TLS and load balancing.
- Cloud Edge Network.
- Monitoring and logs.

### Sign up there and follow the [quickstart](https://cloud.laravel.com/docs/quickstart):

- Connect your GitHub account
- Grant access to your repo (this repo)
- Setup environment variables (like your database URL)
